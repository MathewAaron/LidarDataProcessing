# LidarDataProcessing

## Processing an EKF based localization with Lidar + Radar data used from Udacity Self Driving course

The Lidar gives positional data in cartesian co-ordinates. Whereas, Radar gives position and velocity in Polar co-ordinates.

The EKF algorithm is developed in Python3. Code optimization is being worked on.

The results from the algorithm :
